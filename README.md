# Real-Time-Chat-Website

I have created a website in which people can join and have a chat .

In the Html file i have created a Container in which the messages will appear and using CSS i have designed this such that the container can be scrolled
if the client clicks on send then i have added a evenlistener which will send the message and also will get a message notification sound

If a new client is joined then it shows that the new member is joined
